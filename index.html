                            My name is Neil Taison Rigaud, and I am passionate about Computer Science. I am excited 
                            about the world of Data Science and its potential to transform the world. As an aspiring 
                            engineer, I am fascinated by the ability to solve complex problems using cutting-edge 
                            technologies. I believe that Computer Science skills are essential for everyone to learn 
                            in the near future, as they have become a crucial component of every industry.
                            <br><br>
                            My focus is on AI and Data Science, and I am determined to create innovative tools and 
                            techniques for financial data analysis. My goal is to develop machine learning algorithms 
                            and data visualization tools that will revolutionize the industry and empower individuals 
                            and businesses to make better decisions.
                            <br><br>
                            With hard work, dedication, and a passion for innovation, I am confident that I can make a 
                            positive change in the world. Let's use the power of technology to make a difference together!

                            Thanks to FreeCodeCamp, I am becoming a skilled web developer. Their courses have helped 
                            me learn HTML, CSS, and other technologies. I completed the Responsive Web Design course 
                            and got a certificate. I also learned Python scientific and completed five projects. Now, 
                            I am learning Javascript and excited to continue growing. FreeCodeCamp's platform is 
                            user-friendly and community-driven. I am grateful for their support and look forward to 
                            my future as a web developer.

                        <p>
                            Learning Microsoft Powershell has been a game-changer for me. I appreciate the power of 
                            automation and how it streamlines tasks. I acquired invaluable knowledge and skills that 
                            made me more productive. I also learned Node JS, a powerful JavaScript environment, which 
                            opened up new possibilities for me. I feel more confident using the command line, and I 
                            understand computer functioning better. Learning from industry experts has been great, and 
                            I look forward to exploring automation and programming further.

                            Codewars is my favourite playground for honing my coding skills. It challenges me to solve 
                            problems and implement solutions, whether I'm refining my fundamentals or developing advanced 
                            skills. The platform's exercises are engaging, diverse, and promote growth and learning. I 
                            believe that practice makes perfect, and Codewars has been an incredibly effective tool for 
                            improving my problem-solving abilities and deepening my understanding of the language. I am 
                            grateful for the opportunity to learn from and compete with fellow coders on this platform. It 
                            has been a fantastic experience, and I look forward to continuing to grow and learn with Codewars.

                        <p>
                            LeetCode is a great platform for programmers to test their skills and prepare for job interviews. 
                            Its range of problems challenges users to think creatively and improve their problem-solving abilities. 
                            The platform's emphasis on daily practice and consistency is what sets it apart. Its interactive nature 
                            and real-world application make it an ideal tool for improving coding skills or preparing for job 
                            interviews. Top companies also use LeetCode to find talented programmers, making it an excellent 
                            opportunity for career growth. I encourage anyone looking to improve their coding skills or prepare 
                            for job interviews to give LeetCode a try. With its engaging and challenging exercises, it provides a 
                            great opportunity to learn, grow, and succeed.

                            My name is Neil Taison Rigaud. Born in Haiti in 2000, and living now in Taiwan.
                            I am interested in Computer Science, more specifically in Data Science 
                            and how engineers use their skills to solve real-world problems. I believe that 
                            Computer Science skills has become essential for everyone to learn in the next few 
                            years. This discipline is part of everyone's lives, and is present in every field now.
                            <br>
                            Through AI and Data Science, I want to develop tools and techniques for financial data 
                            analysis, including machine learning algorithms and data visualization tools.

                        <p>
                            This platform helped me learn the basic of HTML and CSS.
                            I obtained the certificate of completion of the Responsive 
                            Web Design course.
                            <br>
                            I also gain some skills with the Python scientific course they 
                            offered and achieved certification by completing five projects.<br>
                            <br>
                            Right now I am following the course on introduction to Javascript.<br> 
                        </p>

                    <li><a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft Learn</a>
                        <p>
                            I learned the importance of using Microsoft Powershell and how useful 
                            it is when automating tasks. This course brought me closer to the
                            computer and made me feel confortable using the command line.
                            <br>
                            I was also introduced to Node JS and basic programming concepts in 
                            Javascript.

                        <p>
                            One of my favourite playground is Codewars. There I can practice the things I 
                            have learned by solving problems, and implementing the solutions. It is very 
                            effective either you want to train your fundamentals or develop more advanced 
                            skills. The only thing you have to remember is that practice makes perfect.

                            This platform provides problems to for programmers to test their skills, but 
                            also to prepare for job interviews. It is pretty good, if you stick to it and 
                            hone your skills daily, you might land your dream job.                         </p>
